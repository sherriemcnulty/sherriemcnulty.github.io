            DECEMBER 2000 - AUGUST 2001<br>
            Avid Technologies, Tewksbury, MA - Sr. Software Engineer
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Initiated and built an in-house content management system that enabled journalists to publish materials on our website
                  with automatic archiving using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. This was an idea I initiated as a cost savings over buying
                  a content management suite from Rational Rose from which we needed a small suite of functionality.

               <li>
                  Initiated the addition of graphical user interfaces to production tools to reduce material waste due to improper text
                  entry. Additional benefits included faster throughput and reduced time required to train new staff.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Initiated and created an in-house web application to improve communication between production engineers and the software
                  development group. It also provided a forum for production engineers to communicate with each other across sites.

            Applied Analysis Inc., Westford, MA - Software Engineer
            <ul>
               <li>
                  Developed a bathymetry prototype that won a $400,000 grant to start development of what later became a corner-stone
                  product.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Voluntarily filled in as acting software group lead at which time I led our migration from exclusively UNIX systems to a
                  multi-platform network. This included integration of legacy C code that ran on UNIX systems with C++ running on both
                  Windows and UNIX systems with minimal code changes.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Created an in-house automated release and version control system that compiled, released and maintained software
                  versions for multiple environments and across platforms. This saved development time, improved the reliability of code
                  releases and enabled quick reliable roll-back of code.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Maintained Computers and peripherals for two LANs, one of which was a closed LAN that we used for handling sensitive
